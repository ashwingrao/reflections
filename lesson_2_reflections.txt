What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Creates a .git file in the folder. Need that to let GIT know to start tracking files


git reset lesson_2_reflections.txt

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
ability to group files to be managed at the same time

git diff (difference between working area & staging area

git diff --staged (difference between staging area & repository)

git reset --hard

git checkout master - to leave 'detached HEAD' state


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Keep all the files that correspond to the logical change in the staging before committing!


get branch
get branch easy-mode
get checkout easy-mode


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When we want to keep a stable version while making code changes


git log --graph --oneline master coin

get checkout -b new_branch_name
get branch new_branch_name
git checkout new_branch_name


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

git merge master coins
git show # to show differences between commit & parent
git branch -d coins

git merge --abort

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Merged the branch to the master... because now the master has changed to the new normal.
