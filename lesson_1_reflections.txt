How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I found it very easy to see the diffs between the two files to narrow down my scope of the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I don't have to manage multiple versions manually, thus allowing me to focus on what I do best! generate great code!

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because in coding features span multiple files.

git clone https://github.com/udacity/asteroids.git
git config --global color.ui auto


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
It will allow me to see what changed at what time, so I can understand why I made some changes.

git checkout - previous version of the code
git checkout -b (for as a new branch)


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can make changes knowing very well that Git is keeping track fo the changes to help me revert back.


git config --global push.default upstream
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
